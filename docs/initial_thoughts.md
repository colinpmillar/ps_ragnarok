# Initial thoughts on streamlining recurrent assessments

## Core issues we are addressing

* reproducability
* transparency
* data quality
* efficient time use

## Project/framework design guide

* Encapsulated framework
* use existing procedures and processes
* ***designed flexibility***

## percieved/hoped for benefits

* more time for experts to spend on problem solving
* more control over inputs and outputs

## constraints

* deliver in 2 years
* minimal upkeep?

## wider issues

* buy in by stock assessors
* issues with ownership od assessments
* the variety of approaches
* how much standardisation to apply / impose
* lessons from intercatch?
* who updates the procedures at benchmark?
* user freindly

## Scoping possibilities

* allow "organic" working: each stock assessment is independent and gets its own methods and processes that evolve over time
* streamline working: stocks are restricted in thier use of tools and data to be of a type defined by us.

At one end of the spectrum an example would be to take al the stock assessments as they are, and fix everything, only alowing the user to change the inputs.
